# Project-2
I will be creating a Kansas City running community web page
- **Description**
  - This project is the second major projects completed in the General Assembly SEI Course.
  - The goal of the project was to create a full stack CRUD online web page that with the use of Node.js, Postgres, Expresss and EJS.
  - The game that I chose to create was a runnign community events/blog web page that will allow the members of the Kansas City running community find opportunities to practice, race, give tips, and communicate over running.
- **Brief Example**
  - When on the web page there will be four main tabs practices, race schedules, tips, and swap meet
    - practices
        - This will be a page where the host of the website can plan out community training events on the web page and people can look up when, where, and what practices will be held
        - Users are also able to RVSP to the workouts so the host will know how many people will be attending
        - Users will also be able to "like/dislike" workouts to show the host what is perferred by the community
    - race schedule
        - This will be a web page with there will show a list of scheduled races in the area
        - users will be able to follow links to the race webpage to find more info/sign up
    - tips
        - The host/users will be able to post/lookup running tips on this web page
        - Users can then comment and like or dislike the tips
        - Users can organize the tips based on date added/number of like/number of comments
    - swap meet
        - the swap meet is where people will be able to post items to be sold in the running community
        - similar to a craiglist add it will get more of a focus on to running gear for the running community

- **User stories**
- As a runner in kansas city, we always see the running trails full of people, but almost always see people running alone. The practice schedule will give people an opportunity to find times to run with others in the community and find a new running partner

- It can be hard to get started running in a new place. The tips and forums section will help a person get started. Finding a good place to run or a solid stretch to do to losen up before their activity.

- With running we know that you will become physically healthy. But social health should also play a large part in it. This website will be made to bridge that gap.
